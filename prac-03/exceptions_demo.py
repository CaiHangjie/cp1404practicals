CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:

1. When will a ValueError occur?
# An error occurs when the user enters a value that cannot be converted to an integer.

2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
# If the user enters the denominator 0, an error occurs because dividing by zero is undefined.

3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?
# Yes, can change the code to check if the denominator is 0 before you perform the division.
